# buildspace-nft-projects

This repository includes two iterations of the Buildspace nft project:  New Frens + Story Starters.

New Frens follows (for the most part) the project directions.

Story Starters is a variation on the project that includes Chainlink VRF.  It's currently undergoing revision so it will work.

RandomArtVRF is a fork of a working VRF contract that we (Chainlink Hackathon team) adapted to better understand how Chainlink VRF works with SVG images.
